## dnd-timeline: A headless timeline library, based on [`dnd-kit`](https://docs.dndkit.com/)



- **Headless:** `dnd-timeline` is a headless-ui library, and contains 0 styling, aside from functional styling (position, z-index, etc.).
- **Hook-based:** exposes simple hooks like `useItem` and `useRow`, that should integrate seamlessly into your existing architecture.
- **Flexible:** very slim and flexible by design. `dnd-timeline` exposes utility functions and positional styling, and you can use them in conjunction with you favorite libraries - styling libraries (MUI, tailwindcss, ant-design, etc.), and functional libraries (react-virtual, framer-motion, etc.)
- **Based on [`dnd-kit`](https://docs.dndkit.com/):** all features exposed by the [`dnd-kit`](https://docs.dndkit.com/) library are applicable to dnd-timeline.
- **Performant:** renders only when needed. All the intermediate states and animations are done using css transformations, and require 0 re-renders.
- **RTL:** `dnd-timeline` nativly supports RTL. simply declare one of the parent divs as rtl with `dir="rtl"`, and thats it.

## Contribute

This project uses [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to manage the monorepo.
It also uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) instead of npm as a package manager.

To install pnpm, you can run:
```sh
corepack enable pnpm
```

If you want to develop on your local machine, simply clone the project, and run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

And all the examples will run on your local machine, likned to the local instance of the library.
Any changes made to the library will be reflected in the examples.

If you want to run only a specific example, checkout turborepo's [`--filter`](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters) operator:
```sh
pnpm run dev --filter home...
```
For example this will run the `home` package and all the packages' it is depending on (`dnd-timeline`).
